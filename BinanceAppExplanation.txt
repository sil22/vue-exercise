Brief explanation of Binance App creation
1. Steps to setup the project
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

2. Project Stucture
The project structure created was following the structure the Nuxt js suggests. Having the components, 
layouts, pages, static and store folder. 

In the Components folder the UI components were included. In this case, the card and the table used to show the coins data.

In Layouts folder, were included the components that will be reused in the diferent pages, and the full-layout that includes
the Header and Footer and Nuxt tag, where the content is injected depending on the routes of each component. 

In Pages folder there is the index file that is the first page showed in Binance App, let's say the Home Page, containing the Table component,and 
also there are declared the mapGetteres and mapActions to fetch the coins data from the store.

Store has the state of the app, the getters, mutations and actions. In actions is where we connect with the API, 
and get all the coins given. The index file is nedeed to active the store in Nuxt. 

Static folder is where we have the coins we are interested to show.

3. App Decisions 
- Vuetify was imported to give the project a kindly view and to show the coins table and the coin details. 
- The UI components are Table.js and Card.js that can be reused across the project.
- _coin.vue is the compenent to show the selected Coin and its data.
- To route to pages, the $route.push was used, sending as parameters the name that Nuxt creates in the router.js file. 

4. App Functionality 
In the Binance App you will see the listed coins 'BTCUSDT', 'ETHUSDT', 'ADAUSDT', 'LTCUSDT', 'AXSUSDT', 'BNBUSDT' in the Home page,
you will be able to Order by: weightedAvgPrice, volume, and most recently visited, Search the coins by name and click the coin you 
would like to see in more detail. 
In addition, there is a button "Refresh Values" to manually refresh the coins values, also there is a timer to update 
the coins values every 10 seconds and will show an alert on the right top where you can close by clicking on "Close" button. 

To search any coin, its necessary to search in capital letters, then you can click on the coin row and will redirect to the _coin page. 
There you will see the whole coin data, such as: highPrice, lowPrice, openPrice, askPrice and bidPrice.
